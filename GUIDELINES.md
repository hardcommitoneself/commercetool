General guidelines about how to successfully develop an application based on [commercetools JVM SDK](https://github.com/commercetools/commercetools-jvm-sdk) with [Play Framework](https://www.playframework.com/).

###Controllers
Controllers should do all HTTP related stuff.

#####Take care of
* HTTP requests and responses.
* Cookies and sessions.
* Forms.
* Context and other Play lifecycle specific stuff.
* Templates.

#####Patterns and rules
* Dependency injection of services.
* Simple code.
* Should end with the word "Controller".
* Most likely does not have mutable state.
* Separate controller classes according to login required or not, then use controller-wide annotations.

#####How do tests look like
* Check cookies and sessions.
* Check response code.
* Check certain words in response content.
* Use `callAction` with `fakeRequest` from Play.
* Extend test classes like `WithApplication` instead of creating an anonymous runnable in every test method.

###Services
Services request domain related stuff, usually to external services.

#####Take care of
* Sphere and any other service needed.
* Communication with external systems.
* No access to HTML templates, except for email templates.

#####Patterns and rules
* Asynchronous calls for external services.
* Interface with implementation to mock external result.
* May be reused.
* May end with with the term "Service".
* Should be thread-safe.
* Most likely doesn't have mutable members.

#####How do tests look like
* Should never use running application.
* Use mocking for external system.

###Models
Models hold local data containers and domain logic.

#####Take care of
* Only aware of other models.

#####Patterns and rules
* Immutable objects.
* Highly reused.
* Created by static factory methods or builders.
* Should not end with the term "Model".

#####How do tests look like
* Should never use running application.
* No dependency injection should be necessary.

###Views
Views generate pages with data provided by controller “as is”, with almost no logic.

#####Take care of
* Template parameters.
* Internal URLs by reverse routing.
* Optionally request, session or context (but harder to test).
 
#####Patterns and rules
* `Optional` class instances, to easily generate default messages.

#####How do tests look like
* Without running application (in Play 2.2.x is not every time possible).
* No dependency injection should be necessary.

###Utils
Util classes hold common re-used methods among different classes.

#####Take care of
* Other util classes, if any.

#####Patterns and rules
* Final classes with static methods and private constructors.
* No observable state changes.
* No instance members.

#####How do tests look like
* Without running application.

###In general
* Unit tests in `test` folder, integration tests in `it` folder, tests with a running Play application in `pt` folder.
* Use Java 7 new features:
    * [`AutoCloseable`](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/AutoCloseable.html) and [`Closeable`](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/Closeable.html) interfaces
    * [Type inference](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/genTypeInference.html)
    * [`try-with-resources`](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/exceptions/tryResourceClose.html)
    * [Multicatch Exceptions](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/language/catch-multiple.html)
    * [`Objects`](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Objects.html) class methods, e.g. `equals`, `hashCode` or `requireNonNull`.
* Take special care when naming classes or methods.
    * Never use "helper" in the name.
* Use fully qualified class names when using Scala classes that clashes with JDK standard classes (e.g. use `scala.collection.mutable.StringBuilder`, as it clashes with `java.lang.StringBuilder`).
* Only self written code should exist in the GIT repository, any external JavaScript and CSS should be loaded with Webjars.
* Do not hesitate to use `*` for imports, especially for `import static play.test.Helpers.*;`.
* Java 8 streams.

## Hints

### Use config instead of hard coded values

before:

```java
public class XController extends SunriseController {
    private static final int PAGE_SIZE = 9;
}
```

after:

```java
public class XController extends SunriseController {
    private final int pageSize;

        @Inject
        public ProductCatalogController(final Configuration configuration) {
            this.pageSize = configuration.getInt("pop.pageSize");
        }
}
```
